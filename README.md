## Description
This application allows a user to search a city and returns weather information about that location using OpenWeather API data. Specific data is returned for the city including a 5 day forecast. Past searches are available on the page as well for easy access to frequented locations. This challenge tested local server and API knowledge and was our first time seeing a full stack application. The assignment was to complete the back end, connect it to the front end using routes and deploy the application using Render.

## Contribution Guidelines
I am open to collaborations. Suggestions on how to fix the routes are welcome as I would like the application to function properly. Any changes should made on a feature branch and pull requests will need to be reviewed before being added to the main branch.

## Credits
I'd like to give credit to my study partners Mina and Fischer who were great to bounce ideas off of and helped me work through some bugs in my functions. The Xpert Learning Assistant on BootCampSpot was able to suggest solutions to some bugs within the "tow" and "wheelie" methods. My tutor Charlie helped me write code in the weatherRoutes file and included a solution that would bypass the weatherService file entirely.
